# üöÄ Deployment Guide: Railway + Vercel

This guide will walk you through deploying your Workie.lk application with:
- **Backend** on Railway (Node.js/Express API + Socket.IO)
- **Frontend** on Vercel (React/Vite)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [ ] Git installed and project pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- [ ] Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com)
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account (or another MongoDB hosting service)
- [ ] Cloudinary account for image uploads
- [ ] Email service credentials (Gmail App Password recommended)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 1: Set Up MongoDB (if not already done)

### Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click **"Build a Database"**
4. Choose **"M0 Free"** tier
5. Select a cloud provider and region (choose closest to your users)
6. Click **"Create Cluster"**
7. Create a database user:
   - Click **"Database Access"** ‚Üí **"Add New Database User"**
   - Choose **"Password"** authentication
   - Create username and strong password
   - Set privileges to **"Read and write to any database"**
8. Set up network access:
   - Click **"Network Access"** ‚Üí **"Add IP Address"**
   - Click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (0.0.0.0/0)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This is okay for development, but for production consider using Railway's static IPs
9. Get your connection string:
   - Click **"Database"** ‚Üí **"Connect"**
   - Choose **"Connect your application"**
   - Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:<password>@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/`)
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password
   - Add database name: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/workie_db`

## üöÇ STEP 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

### 2.1 Create Railway Project

1. Go to https://railway.app and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Select your **Workie.lk** repository
5. Railway will detect your project structure

### 2.2 Configure Backend Service

1. Railway may detect multiple services - select the **backend** folder
2. If not detected automatically:
   - Click **"Settings"**
   - Set **Root Directory** to `backend`
   - Set **Start Command** to `npm start`

### 2.3 Set Environment Variables

1. In your Railway project, click on your backend service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"New Variable"** and add each of these:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=generate_a_random_secret_at_least_32_characters_long
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
```

**Important Notes:**
- Generate a strong JWT_SECRET: You can use this command in terminal:
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
- For EMAIL_PASSWORD, use Gmail App Password (not your regular Gmail password):
  - Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
  - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
- You'll update FRONTEND_URL after deploying to Vercel

### 2.4 Deploy Backend

1. Railway will automatically deploy after setting variables
2. Wait for deployment to complete (check the logs)
3. Once deployed, click **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Generate Domain"**
4. Railway will give you a URL like: `https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app`
5. **Save this URL** - you'll need it for frontend configuration

### 2.5 Test Backend

1. Open your Railway backend URL in browser: `https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app`
2. You should see a response from your API
3. Test health endpoint: `https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app/api/health`

---

## ‚ö° STEP 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 3.1 Create Vercel Project

1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Select your **Workie.lk** repository
4. Vercel will detect the configuration

### 3.2 Configure Frontend Deployment

1. In the project configuration screen:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite (should auto-detect)
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`

### 3.3 Set Environment Variables

1. Before deploying, expand **"Environment Variables"**
2. Add these variables:

```plaintext
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app
```

Replace `your-backend-name.up.railway.app` with your actual Railway backend URL from Step 2.4

### 3.4 Deploy Frontend

1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait for build and deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)
3. Once deployed, Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
4. Click on the URL to see your live site!

---

## üîÑ STEP 4: Update Backend with Frontend URL

Now that you have your Vercel frontend URL, update the backend:

1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Update the **FRONTEND_URL** variable with your Vercel URL:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   ```
5. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variable

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 5: Verify Deployment

### Test Backend:
- [ ] Visit: `https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] Should return a health check response

### Test Frontend:
- [ ] Visit: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- [ ] Try logging in or signing up
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test real-time features (notifications, socket connections)
- [ ] Try uploading an image
- [ ] Test job posting and applications

### Common Issues:

**CORS Errors:**
- Make sure FRONTEND_URL in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
- Check your backend server.js CORS configuration

**API Not Connecting:**
- Verify VITE_API_URL in Vercel includes `/api` at the end
- Check Railway logs for errors

**Socket.IO Not Working:**
- Verify VITE_SOCKET_URL does NOT include `/api`
- Check that Socket.IO is properly configured in backend

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify MongoDB connection string is correct
- Check that IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas includes 0.0.0.0/0

## üîß STEP 6: Post-Deployment Configuration

### 6.1 Custom Domain (Optional)

**For Vercel (Frontend):**
1. Go to your Vercel project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `workie.lk`)
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

**For Railway (Backend):**
1. Go to your Railway service ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Networking**
2. Add custom domain (e.g., `api.workie.lk`)
3. Update VITE_API_URL in Vercel after setting up

### 6.2 Environment-Specific Settings

Make sure these are set correctly:

**Railway (Backend):**
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Rate limiting should be enabled
- Logging configured for production

**Vercel (Frontend):**
- Production build optimizations enabled (automatic)
- Source maps disabled in production (for security)
