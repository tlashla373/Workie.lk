# ✅ Worker Verification - Rating Filter Implementation

## What Was Implemented

The admin panel worker verification now **only shows workers with average rating > 3.0**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (`backend/routes/admin.js`)

- **Fetches all workers** with ID documents first
- **Calculates average rating** from client-to-worker reviews
- **Filters to show only workers with rating > 3.0**
- **Sorts by rating** (highest first)
- **Returns paginated results**

### 2. Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/Admin/AdminVerifications.jsx`)

- Updated header: "Rating > 3.0 required"
- Updated stats card: "Eligible Workers for Verification"
- Updated empty state message
- Shows green badge: "Rating > 3.0 ✓" for all workers

### 3. Test Script (`backend/test-rating-filter.js`)

- Tests which workers will appear
- Shows rating details for each worker
- Lists eligible vs ineligible workers

## How to Test

```bash
cd backend
node test-rating-filter.js
```

## Current Status

```
📝 Found 0 workers with both ID photos uploaded
⚠️ No workers found with ID documents.
```

## Eligibility Requirements

Workers must have:

1. ✅ Both ID photos uploaded (front and back)
2. ✅ **Average rating > 3.0** (from client-to-worker reviews)
3. ✅ Not already verified

## Admin Panel Display

Only workers meeting **all** criteria appear in the list:

- Each worker shows their rating with star icon
- Green badge: "Rating > 3.0 ✓"
- Sorted by highest rating first

## Key Points

- ✅ Only **client-to-worker reviews** count
- ✅ Workers with **no reviews** (rating 0.0) will NOT appear
- ✅ Rating must be **> 3.0** (not >= 3.0)
- ✅ Filter happens on **backend** (efficient)

## Documentation

See `RATING_FILTER_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete details.

**System is ready!** Workers with rating > 3.0 will automatically appear in the admin verification panel. 🎉
